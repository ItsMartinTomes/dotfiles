The network Lifecycle Management	process describes the various stages that a network goes through from design to deployment and ongoing management. This lifecycle is split into three main phases:
## Day 0: Network Design and Integration Tasks
- Day 0 is focused on **network design and integrations**, setting up the framework for the network before deployment. Also called as **technology onboarding** and **pre-production**.
- ### Key Activities:
	- **Network Planning and Design**: Defining network architecture and components.
	- **Vendor Selection**: Choosing hardware, software, and service providers.
	- **Integration Requirements**: Ensuring compatibility with existing systems.
	- **Capacity Planning**: Estimating resources like bandwidth and storage for future scalability.
	- **Testing and Validation**: Confirming that the design is functional and meets requirements. Infrastructure cluster testing and performance benchmarking testing is done here.
	- **POC**: Proof of Concepts or demos are presented to the customers.
- ### Goals:
	- Establish network design that supports business objectives.
	- Ensure seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
	- Plan for future growth without performance bottlenecks.
## Day 1: Deployment
- Day 1 is about the **actual deployment** of the network. This includes provisioning, configuring, and testing the network to ensure it meets the expectations set in Day 0. Also called **production**.
- ### Key Activities:
	- **Provisioning**: Installing and configuring hardware and software.
	- **Automation**: Using automated tools to reduce deployment time and errors.
	- **Testing**: Running tests to ensure functionality.
	- **Initial Monitoring**: Setting up systems to monitor performance and health.
	- **Security Setup**: Configuring firewalls, access controls, and other security measures.
- ### Goals:
	- Deploy network components based on design.
	- Ensure functional and secure network setup.
	- Get the network operational and ready for users.
## Day 2+: Lifecycle Management and Operations
- Day 2 covers **ongoing network management and operations**, ensuring that the network remains healthy, secure, and optimized.
- ### Key Activities:
	- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Continuous monitoring for faults and performance issues.
	- **Optimization**: Fine-tuning network components and configurations for better performance.
	- **Security Updates and Patching**: Regular updates to ensure security and compliance.
	- **Scaling**: Adding resources as needed to meet growing demand.
	- **Compliance and Auditing**: Ensuring network meets regulatory standards.
	- **Backup and Recovery**: Implementing disaster recovery plans.
- ### Goals:
	- Ensure the network operates efficiently and securely.
	- Proactively resolve issues and scale as needed.
	- Maintain a reliable and secure infrastructure over time.
## Conclusion

The network Lifecycle Management (LCM) process ensures that a network is effectively designed, deployed, and maintained throughout its operational lifetime. By dividing the lifecycle into Day 0 (design), Day 1 (deployment), and Day 2 (operations), organizations can ensure their networks are secure, efficient, and adaptable to future needs.
