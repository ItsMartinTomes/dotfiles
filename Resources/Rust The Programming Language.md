## Notes
### 1. Getting Started
- 
- 
- 
- `Cargo.toml` 
- 
- 
- 
- [Build](Rust/Cargo/Build.md) 
- 
- 
- 
- 
### 2. Guessing Game
- 
- 
	- If something is not in the current scope (prelude), I have to bring it with:
		- rust code block below:
		```rust
			use std::io;
			```
- 
- . Once the variable have a value, the value will not change.
- 
- 
- 
- 
	- Result has an `expect` method that you can call.
		-  that you did not use Result
			- This forces you writing safer code with as much error handling as possible. Only by error handling you can get rid off the error.
