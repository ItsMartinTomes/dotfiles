Unfortunately, programming languages mixes procedure/procedure/functions with keyword. eg [Go](Go.md) and [Rust](Rust.md) have keyword `func` for both procedures and functions.
- [Perl](Perl.md) uses `sub` and call it subroutine for both subroutines/procedures and fucntions
- bash has `function` keyword etc
	- byt assembly uses term `subroutine` only
