General notes about functions
Function typically returns a value unlike [Procedures](Procedures.md)
It is NOT Procedure, [Operation](Operation.md) (Interface) nor [Method](Method.md).
It is named and can accept arguments (but does not have to have any 
input. But it should have an input).
Ideally a black box (pure function). Input in and return out.
A function is self-contained and can be **tested** much more easily than procedures.
Example: get object. sum x and y.
