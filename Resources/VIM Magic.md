`:! command` runs the command from vim
`:.!command` execute the command and return the output into current VIM buffer
- the dot `.` means current active line
	- thus the command brings the result of the command back to vim on the current line where **replaces** the current data
`!!command` equivalent of `:.!` you do not have to go to command mode with `:`
